        <p>Hello! My name is Ã‡aÄŸan Seyrek. I am currently in my 3rd year studying computer engineering.</p>
        <p>I began my programming adventure back in 2014 with HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript (not really programming but anyways haha). Since the day I started, my interest and curiosity in programming has grown every day. Because of this interest and curiosity, I decided to study computer engineering.</p>
        <p>Although I initially focused on front-end when I first started programming, after I got into university, I also became interested in back-end and improved myself in that field too. Now I continue my path as a full-stack developer.</p>
        <div class="container">Also my name might look a little hard to pronounce. It's pronounced like "chaan". The letter "Ã‡" is pronounced like "ch" as in "chocolate" and the letter "ÄŸ" is not pronounced at all ðŸ¤“</div>
        <p>I enjoy working with different languages and various frameworks. I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks to work with. Here's a brief list of the languages, frameworks and databases I work with and some tools that I use on my projects:</p>
